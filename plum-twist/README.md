# Plum Twist

Pinouts and wiring instructions: [see the Plum Twist website](https://ryanis.cool/cosmos/plum-twist/wiring).

## Manufacturing

To maintain compatibility with the [sockets in Cosmos](https://github.com/rianadon/Cosmos-Keyboards/blob/main/src/assets/key-mx-pcb-plum.step), make sure you manufacture these with 1.2mm thickness.

To assemble these yourself these you'll need 1x of these for every PCB:

- 1N4148 Diodes in SOD-323 Package
- Kailh MX Hotswap Sockets (CPG151101S11)
- SK6812MINI-E LEDs (optional and frankly not worth the time)

The hotswap sockets are the most expensive of the three and AliExpress tends to have the best prices for them. YMMV.
